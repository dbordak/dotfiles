(I'm going to replace this with a markdown readme later.)

This is my dotfiles repo. I'm really new at this so I doubt anyone wants these,
they're really just here for my own benefit. This has my configuration files
for bspwm, sxhkd, vim and some associated plugins, urxvt (and potentially
other low-level X applications), zsh (using prezto), and X.

My .vimrc is cobbled together from other sources, some of the other files are
probably such, too. I'm going to rewrite it myself later once I've got a better
idea of what I actually want in there.
